Hi Raju, 

Thank you for reaching out immediately. Our records indicate you were marked as absent in the most recent session despite the fact that you showed up. The reason behind is that you stayed in less than half of the class duration.

As you know from our [course policies](https://https/courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19#heading-time-commitment) We only allow 3 absences with prior notice.

Please take all of that above into consideration for next time in order to avoid any unintentional absences.

All the best,
[CodePath.org](http://codepath.org/) Team
