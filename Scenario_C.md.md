Hi Farhan,

Thanks for reaching out and informing me. Hope you are feeling well after the side effects of COVID vaccination.

First, let me inform you that whenever you are facing technical difficulties you are more than welcome to reach out to the Slack Unit Help Channels (e.g. android-unit05-spring21) or the Discussions System (<https://discussions.codepath.com/>) to receive assistance from our Tech Support.

Also as an exception for only one time, you will be granted for another 24 hour to complete the assignment.

Please let me know if you will have any other questions regarding our Slack Channels or Tech Support.

All the best,
[CodePath.org](http://codepath.org/) Team
