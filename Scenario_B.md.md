Hello Pia,

Thanks for reaching out. Our records indicate you were marked as absent for the past 4 sessions and it lead you to the policy-related withdrawal.

Despite of the fact that we do appreciate your interest, hard work and dedication towards the CodePath Cybersecurity course, we do not want you to be so overworked.

Instead, we offer you to take the course next semester when you have less load and better availability.

Please let us know what you think about our offer.

All the best,
[CodePath.org](http://codepath.org/) Team
