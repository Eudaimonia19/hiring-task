Hello Ranchodas,

We heard you were accepted into an internship at Microsoft. Congratulations!

As requested, from now on you will be moved as an observer, which means:

1. You will have a lifetime access to the course material and will be able to study it at your own pace.
1. No due dates or any expectations of observers imposed by us.
1. We invite you to join our [mailing list](https://https/share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) to receive updates on upcoming courses and events.

We hope to see you again on our courses soon!

All the best,
[CodePath.org](http://codepath.org/) Team
